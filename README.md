# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

A project that explores the implementation of minimax search to play a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that I designed during my time at the Jane Street AMP summer program in 2022.

## Project Description

The project implements a simple Tic-tac-toe game that allows for inputs from the console or a wide array of agents with differing levels of skill.

The project is organized into two primary tools. The first is an interactive console environment to play the game while the second is a simulation environment that allows for the comparison of different agents over a sample of trials. Each of these are provided by the 'TicTacToe.py' and 'Simulation.py' scripts, respectively.

## Interactive Console Environment

To run the interactive console environment, one may download the contents of the repository, and then call the 'TicTacToe.py' script from a console. The agents can be configured by editing the main function of the script. More guidance is provided in comments of the script file itself.

## Simulation Environment

To use the tools within the simulation module and environment, one can download the contents of the repository, and then import the module into another python or jupyter notebook file of their choice. An example implementation of tools provided within the environment can be found within the script itself.
